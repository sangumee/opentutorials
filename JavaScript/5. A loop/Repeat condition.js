/*

Let's interpret the grammar of the loop that we saw at the beginning of this class. The following loop determines the continuation of the repetition by sequentially increasing the value of i by one. Take a careful look at the annotated description.

var i = 0;
// The exit condition is true if i is less than 10, and false if i is less than 10.

while (i < 10) {
