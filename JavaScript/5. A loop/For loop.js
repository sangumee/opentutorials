/*

The for statement is initialized first. In the above example, initialization is var i = 0; That is, the value of the variable i is set to zero. Next, i <10, which is a 'repeat condition', is executed. The current value of i is zero. So this condition is true. If the iteration condition is true, the contents inside the braces are executed. Since the value of i is 0, the text 'coding everybody0 <br />' is output. When the execution of the 'code to be executed repeatedly' is completed, the 'code to be executed every time it is executed' is executed. I ++ means to add 1 to the current i value. The current value of i is zero. Therefore i became 1 as a result of i ++. And 'iteration condition' is executed. The current i value is 1, so i <10 is true. Again, the code to be executed repeatedly is executed. The operation is repeatedly executed. In this process, the value of i is incremented by 1 for each iteration. As a result, when the value of i becomes 10, i <10 is not satisfied and the loop is terminated.
